## Instabase
We will use Instabase for assignment submissions. All of the course assignments use Jupyter notebooks. To avoid each student needing to install Jupyter on his or her computer, Instabase provides Jupyter notebooks hosted in the cloud. Further, we have got other required software packages installed here (Tensorflow, OpenAI gym). Therefore, it is a "ready-to-go" platform for your programming assignments in this course. 

Below are some brief instructions for creating your account on Instabase. 

**IMPORTANT!** `Please use only your columbia email, i.e., yourUNI@columbia.edu and username yourUNI to create your instabase account. Otherwise, your assignments may not get graded.`

## Getting Started
Detailed instructions with pictures on using this platform are here: [Student Guide](docs/Instabase_%20Student%20Guide.docx). Below is a summary.

### Step 1: Get an Instabase account

Go to https://www.instabase.com/account/register?use_token=true <br>
Type in your email (**yourUNI@columbia.edu**) and your desired username (**yourUNI**) and password.<br>
Use the token: **Instructor will give you a token**<br>
Click the Create an account button, complete the email verification process, and youâ€™re all set.<br>
<!--**Note:** If you tried to get an Instabase account without following the link above and were placed on a waiting list, please follow this link [https://www.instabase.com/account/login?use_token=true] to activate your account using the same token as above. -->

#### Step 2: Manage and Explore Repositories

Repositories in Instabase contain your data, notebooks, and other files. They are organized with
folders and files, just like a typical filesystem. Once your account is created and you log in, you
will see an initial repository named my-repo. You can change the repository name by clicking the three vertical dots at the right end of the repository name and selecting Settings from the dropdown menu.

#### Step 3: 
The course link <br>
https://www.instabase.com/sa3305/ieor8100-spring2019 <br>
contains the lab assignments (folder Labs): copy the required lab folder to your repository my-repo. 

#### Step 4:
Right-click or control-click on the notebook for the assignment you want to finish and select Open With > Jupyter.  Sometimes it will take a minute or so for a new Jupyter server to start up on your behalf. Once it does, you are ready to go! <br>
Follow the instructions in the notebook to finish the assignment. At the end of the notebook, there will typically be a link or other instruction to submit the assignment.
